\subsection{Illustration on a simplified brain imaging dataset}
\label{sec:proof_of_concept}

In this section we describe a simple experiment where we use MT-MCVAE to model the joint relationship between MRI and PET-FDG images when there are missing data at train time.
The trained model will be then applied on test data to predict MRI from FDG and \textit{vice versa}.

Data comes from the `Adni2' dataset (\S~\ref{ssec:datasets}, \tabref{table:datasets}), from which we took the MRI and FDG modalities.
In what follows, each one of this two modalities corresponds to a specific data view.
For each subject ($n=424$, with both MRI and FDG) we extracted $3$ brain slices for each one of the sagittal, coronal, and axial plane.
The resulting $3816$ slices were randomly allocated to a training and testing set with respectively sizes of $3500$ and $316$.
We down sampled the slices to $28 \times 28$ images ($784$ pixels).
%
To simulate a datasets with missing views, we controlled for the fraction of observations with complete views ($f$) in the training set:
this procedure is depicted in \figref{fig:nimg_scheme} where we show an example of training dataset created with $f=1/3$.
%
For our experiments we took all the $3500$ training images and we randomly removed MRI and FDG views to obtain different training sets for which $f \in \{0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1\}$.
We adopted a deep architecture with $4$ layers for both encoders and decoders, having ReLU activation functions and layer dimensions of $784-1024-1024-16$ in the encoding and $16-1024-1024-784$ in the decoding path,
an architecture inspired from those used by \cite{dcca1} and \cite{dcca2} for a similar task on the MNIST dataset \citep{mnist}.
We adopted a Gaussian likelihood for the decoders, with independent diagonal covariance parameters, and we trained our model with mini-batches of size $500$ for $3000$ epochs, after setting up the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
Training was repeated $5$ times, by changing the initialization random seed of the model parameters.

In \tabref{tab:nimg} we show the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) when predicting MRI from the FDG slices and \textit{vice versa} in the testing set.
We notice the immediate drop in the error metrics as soon as the parameter $f$ increases, which means that as the model is fed with more and more paired MRI and FDG data points in the trainig set, its predictions on the testing set become more precise.

% In \figref{fig:nimg_test} is possible to visually inspect these predictions.
