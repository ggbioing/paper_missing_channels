\caption{
	Mean squared error (MSE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) - the lower the better -  measured as mean (st.dev) on the reconstructed brain images of the test-set.
	The MRI were used to infer the FDG-PET slices in the same subject, and \textit{vice versa}.
	Results stratified by $f$, the fraction of observations with no missing views in the training set.
	Notice the immediate drop in the error metrics as soon as $f$ increases.
