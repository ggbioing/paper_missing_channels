\caption{
	Mean Squared Reconstruction Error (mean (st.dev.), the lower the better) measured on clinical scores and imaging derived phenotypes predicted with our MT-MCVAE model in MTL experiments.
	Results stratified by the number of layers in the encoder-decoder architecture.
	We measure no significant differences among architectures (anova statistical test at an alpha level of 0.05).
	Best overall results in boldface.
